### Day 8
- Learned about race conditions

- Used Callable to return results from threads
- Used Future to receive login status


### Day 11
- Connected frontend user actions to backend processing
- Learned how multiple user actions are handled safely
- Used thread pool to prevent system overload


## Day 12 – Java Synchronization

**Goal:**  
Understand how Java handles multiple threads accessing shared data.

**What I learned:**  
- How threads can cause data inconsistency
- How `synchronized` ensures only one thread accesses a method at a time
- Why synchronization is important in real-world applications like banking systems

**Key takeaway:**  
`synchronized` prevents multiple threads from modifying shared data at the same time.


## Day 13
-Learned how to handle button clicks using JavaScript
-Practiced using addEventListener to respond to user actions
-Understood how user interaction controls what happens on a web page


### Day 14 – JavaScript Forms

- Prevented form submission when data is incorrect


### Day 15 – Local Storage
- Learned how to save user data in the browser
- Used localStorage to remember user preferences


### Day 16 – Fetch API
- Practiced getting data from an external API
- Displayed fetched data on the web page


### Day 17 – API Error Handling
- Added basic error handling when fetching data
- Displayed messages when requests fail
  

### Day 18 – Loading States
- Added a loading message while fetching data
- Improved user experience during async operations


##Day 19
- Learned how to store user data using localStorage
- Understood how data stays even after page reload
- Used JavaScript to read stored data on page load
- Updated the UI based on saved user information


##Day 20
- Simulated a user profile on the frontend
